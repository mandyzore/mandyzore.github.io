<!--<br><b>Research Interests:</b> Natural Language Processing</p>-->
<p>Hi! I'm a research assistant of at Tsinghua University KEG Lab, under the supervisor 
of <a href="http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/persons/ljz/">Prof. Juanzi Li</a>. Previously, I was an undergraduate 
at Shandong University, from which I received a B.E. in Software Engeering in June 2014.</p>
<p>My research interests lie broadly in Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and Data Mining. Current research is focused on <span style="color:#A52A2A">Information Extraction</span>.</p>
<!--In the past, I have also worked on various projects in computational biology.</p>-->

<h2>Work in Progress</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Joint 5Ws modeling and Event Extraction</b>.<br>
	Starting in June of 2015, I’m working with <a href="http://nlp.cs.rpi.edu/hengji.html">Prof. Heng Ji</a>
	and Juanzi Li’s group on document-level event extraction. Beyond the traditional sentence-level IE task, I
	try to connected all the event pieces cross the whole news document by adding discourse relation between
	sentences. A event network model is expected to constructed firstly. Then propagate the temporal and
	geometry information through the network, and jointly infer each event’s 5Ws and the salient event from this
	network.</p>	
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Experience</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>News monitoring and clustering</b> with Yixin Cao, Linmei Hu,
	and Lei Hou. Cooperation with Xinhua News Agency.<br>
	Starting in Oct. of 2014, we periodically crawled articles from 12 news sites and
	analyzed news trend on several text mining tasks, including news topic classification, hot topic detection,
	topic tracing, and salient event extraction. I mainly worked on the 5Ws extraction for each news on a
	supervised learning fashion. A bunch of NLP tools were tested and combined in my implementation. Our
	work was presented at the APEC in Beijing. One paper submitted to JIST. (<a href="">system</a>, <a href="">presentation</a>)</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><p><b>Automated Question Answering</b> with Yixin Cao, Tao
	Huang and Peng Zhang <br>
	Starting in Sep. of 2014, work involved automated answering bank
	user’s question based on Frequent Asked Questions corpus. we proposed a semi-automatic domain-restricted
	FAQ answering framework SDFA, without relying on any external resources. SDFA detected the targets of
	questions to assist both the fast domain knowledge learning and the answer retrieval. The proposed framework
	had been successfully applied in real project on bank domain. Extensive experiments on two large datasets
	demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the approaches. One paper published on NLPCC. (<a href="">lessons</a>)
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Topic-targeted Influence Maximization in Social Network</b>
	(Undergraduate Thesis).
	<br>
	Starting in Mar. of 2014, the problem I worked on is a new
	scenario of traditional IM problem: how to chose the seed users to maximize the influence on social network
	targeting a certain topic. I combined the topic to the optimization objective and investigated both greedy and
	heuristic algorithm, and then proposed a new heuristic strategy by punishing local influence overlap, which achieved best performance. The experiments were conducted on two huge real-world datasets: a dirctor-actor-writer-movie network from Wikipedia’s movie page and a citation network from AMiner.My thesis on this work with <a href="http://www.cs.sdu.edu.cn/website_person_en.do?id=53">Prof. Jun Ma</a>’s advisor achieved Excellent Undergraduate Thesis honors.
