<p>Hi! I'm a research assistant of at Tsinghua University KEG Lab, under the supervisor 
of <a href="http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/persons/ljz/">Prof. Juanzi Li</a>. Previously, I was an undergraduate 
at Shandong University, from which I received a B.E. in Software Engeering in June 2014.</p>
<p>My research interests broadly lie on Natural language processing, Machine Learning and Data Mining.
 My current research focus on <span style="color:#A52A2A">Information Extraction</span>.</p>
<!--In the past, I have also worked on various projects in computational biology.</p>-->

<h2>Work in Progress</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Joint 5Ws modeling and Event Extraction</b>.<br>
	Starting in June of 2015, I'm working with <a href="http://nlp.cs.rpi.edu/hengji.html">Prof. Heng Ji</a> and Juanzi Li's group
	on event extraction and knowledge base construction.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Experience</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Chinese News Analysis Platform</b> with Yixin Cao, Linmei Hu,
	and Lei Hou.<br>
	Starting in Oct. of 2014, I worked with Professor Juanzi Li's group
	on automated crawling articles from 12 news media sites and classifying 
	news to 8 categories, mining hot topic, tracing salient event and analysing 
	media's reporting trends.
	Our work was presented at the APEC in Beijing.
	(<a href="">system</a>, <a href="">presentation</a>)</p>

<ul>
	<li><p><b>Automated Question Answering System of Bank</b> with Yixin Cao, Tao
	Huang and Peng Zhang <br>
	Starting in Sep. of 2014, this is a collaborated project with Sinovoice Co. on
	question answering system for bank's consultant service.(<a href="">lessons</a>)
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Topic-targeted Influence Maximization in Social Network</b>
	(Undergraduate Thesis).
	<br>
	Starting in Mar. of 2014, I worked on influence maximization problem as my undergraduate thesis.
	I adjusted the classic influence maximization problem by adding topic factor into influence model.<!--
	and proposed three topic-aware methods(i.e. TGG, TNG and TDD), and proposed another new algorithm: TSRS, 
	the topic-aware seed region separation algorithm, based on the spreading of locality influence.
	Executed designed experiments showed that TSRS out perform the TDD algorithm in spread 
	result and far away out perform the TGG algorithm in time efficiency.--> Coded in Python.
	I completed my undergraduate honors thesis with <a href="http://www.cs.sdu.edu.cn/website_person_en.do?id=53">Prof. Jun Ma</a> as my advisor.
